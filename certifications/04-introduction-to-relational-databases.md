## ðŸ“Œ Reflections

This course provided a strong foundation in relational database concepts and practical SQL skills. Key points include:

- Understanding the difference between **relational and non-relational databases**.  
- Designing **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)** to model data structures.  
- Using **DDL** and **DML** statements to create and manage tables.  
- Applying **constraints, keys, and indexes** to ensure data integrity and efficiency.  
- Practicing **normalization** to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.  
- Hands-on work with **MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Db2** using command-line and pgAdmin.  

This certificate strengthened my confidence in database design and SQL, which are essential skills for any Data Engineer.
