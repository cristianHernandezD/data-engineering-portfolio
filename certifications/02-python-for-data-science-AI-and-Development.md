## ðŸ“Œ Reflections

This course provided me with the essential Python skills for data engineering and data science. I learned about:

- Python basics: variables, data types, operators
- Control structures: conditionals, loops, and functions
- Core data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Using external libraries like NumPy and Pandas
- Working with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development

It bridged the gap between theory and hands-on coding, making me feel confident about building data pipelines and performing data manipulations.
