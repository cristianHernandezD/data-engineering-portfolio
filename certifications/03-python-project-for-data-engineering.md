## ðŸ“Œ Reflections

This course allowed me to apply the concepts learned in previous Python courses by working on practical ETL processes. Key points include:

- Building **ETL pipelines** from scratch using Python.
- Extracting data from **web scraping** and **REST APIs**.
- Transforming and cleaning datasets before loading.
- Loading processed data into **SQLite3 databases**.
- Working hands-on with **Jupyter Notebooks** and Python libraries.

The final project reinforced the importance of creating reusable ETL workflows for real-world scenarios. It was a great experience to integrate multiple skills into a single solution.
