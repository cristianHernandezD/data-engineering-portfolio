## ðŸ“Œ Reflections

This course laid a solid foundation for understanding the data engineering ecosystem. I learned about:

- The differences between OLTP and OLAP systems
- Core layers of a data platform
- Various data storage types and when to use them
- Roles and responsibilities of data engineers
- Key tools used in modern data pipelines

It helped me see the big picture and clarified the importance of each layer in the data flow.
