# Project: Introduction to Relational Databases

This project is part of the **IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate**.  
The objective was to design and implement a **relational database system** for a fictional business scenario using **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**.

---

## Project Overview
- **Scenario:** A coffee shop chain based in New York is expanding nationally and needs to centralize data from various systems (accounting, suppliers, POS, spreadsheets).  
- **Goal:** Design and implement a **normalized relational database** to improve data consistency and decision-making.  
- **Tasks:** Identify entities, create ERDs, define keys and relationships, create tables and views, and migrate data between systems.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL** & **pgAdmin** (database design and SQL execution)  
- **MySQL** & **phpMyAdmin** (data migration and staging)  
- **SQL (DDL, DML)**  
- **ERD tools** for relational modeling  
- **CSV exports/imports**

---

## Files Included 
- `data/staff_locations_view.csv` – Exported view containing staff location data.  
- `data/product_info_m-view.csv` – Exported materialized view with product information.  
- `images/` – Screenshots and ERD diagram for the relational model.  
- `README.md` – Project documentation.

---

## Key Features
- Designed a **normalized database schema** following 1NF–3NF principles.  
- Created an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to visualize entities and relationships.  
- Defined **primary and foreign keys** to ensure referential integrity.  
- Created **views** and **materialized views** for analytical use.  
- Migrated data between **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** environments.  

---

## How It Works
1. **Identify Entities & Attributes:** Analyze business data sources to determine entities and attributes.  
2. **Design ERD:** Build the schema in **pgAdmin** and define relationships.  
3. **Normalize Tables:** Apply normalization up to 3NF to reduce redundancy.  
4. **Create Database Objects:** Generate and run SQL scripts to create tables.  
5. **Create Views:** Generate views and materialized views for reporting.  
6. **Data Migration:** Export data from PostgreSQL and import it into MySQL.
