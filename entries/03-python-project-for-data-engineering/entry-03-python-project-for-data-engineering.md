# ✅ Entry 03 – Python Project for Data Engineering  

---

## 📚 What I Learned  
- Implemented the **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** process using Python.  
- Extracted data from different sources: web scraping, REST APIs, and databases.  
- Applied **data cleaning and transformation techniques** with Pandas.  
- Loaded structured data into **SQLite3** using SQL queries.  
- Followed **best coding practices (PEP8)**, implemented **unit testing**, and created Python packages.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Introduced  
- **Python** (Advanced scripting for ETL)  
- **Requests & BeautifulSoup** (Web scraping)  
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation and transformation)  
- **SQLite3** (Database integration)  
- **Unit Testing, PEP8, Static Code Analysis**  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways  
- Gained hands-on experience creating automated **ETL workflows**.  
- Learned how to **extract and integrate data from multiple sources**.  
- Improved skills in **code quality, packaging, and testing**.  
- Strengthened ability to design **scalable and reusable Python projects**.
