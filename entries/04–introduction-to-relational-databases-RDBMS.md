# Entry 04 – Introduction to Relational Databases (RDBMS)

## 📚 What I Learned
- Understood the fundamental differences between relational and non-relational databases.  
- Learned about data models, schemas, and the role of Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).  
- Explored key database concepts like tables, primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, and constraints.  
- Practiced SQL with Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).  
- Understood normalization principles to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity.  
- Worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL, using tools like **pgAdmin** and command-line utilities.  
- Gained insights into database security, data loading techniques, and efficient data retrieval.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Relational databases provide structure and consistency through keys and constraints.  
- ERDs are crucial for designing logical relationships before implementing a database.  
- Normalization is key to reducing redundancy and ensuring data consistency.  
- PostgreSQL and MySQL, while similar, have differences in tools and workflows (pgAdmin vs. MySQL CLI).  
- Security and access control must always be considered when handling relational databases.

## 📌 Reflections
This course helped me connect theoretical concepts with hands-on practice in relational databases.  
I now feel more comfortable with the foundations of relational models and working directly with tools like PostgreSQL and MySQL.  
It also reinforced the importance of planning a database design with ERDs before jumping into implementation.
